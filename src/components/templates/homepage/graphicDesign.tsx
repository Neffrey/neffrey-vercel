            {`Graphic design has been a hobby of mine for 15 years now. Previously
            I really enjoyed digital painting like this Forest Wolf. These types
            of projects were put on the back as most of my time in Photoshop and
            Illustrator was spent making functional art like logos and user
            interfaces. In the future I'd like to have merch with my designs for
            sale here so stay tuned.`}
